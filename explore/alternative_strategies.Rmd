This file explores which strategies other than binary search people might be using.

```{R}
guesses = read_csv("guesses_processed.csv")
```

Let's print out a bunch of different runs to see if we can find a pattern
```{R}
for (i in 1:100){
  i.gameID = sample(guesses$gameId,1)
  i.guesses = guesses[guesses$gameId == i.gameID,]$guess
  i.target = guesses[guesses$gameId == i.gameID,]$targetNum[1]
  print(paste("Target",i.target," : ",paste(i.guesses,collapse = '->'),collapse = ' '))
}
```

## Some strategies:

**Fixed level increase until signal found**: jumping by 10 until lower flips to larger, then using smaller increments
eg `10->20->30->40->50->45->44->43->42`
`8->12->14->16->18->20->24->26->36->46->56->55->54->52->53"`

We could measure this strategy by looking at entropy over the distance of current guess to last guess.

**Random**: apparently just random.

Measure by maximal entropy over distance to last guess?

**Binary search rounded to 10/5â€™s/evens/odds**

Measure by combination of high information gain and a bias for 10's/5's

## Observations

**People surprisingly often start on 100**
