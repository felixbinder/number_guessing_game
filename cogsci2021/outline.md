## Introduction
*One paragraph on motivation and question*\
Imagine you’re trying to find something. There’s an optimal place to look to maximize the information that you get, but figuring out what that is is hard and requires cognitive effort in some cases. How do we trade off how much information we gain with how much cognitive effort we’re willing to put in? 

*One paragraph on one research direction, it’s positive findings and limitations*\
optimal experimental design, decision theory, information gain, Bayesian diagnosticity, value of information (Jonathan Nelson)

*One paragraph on another research direction, it’s positive findings and limitations*\
Resource rational analysis, satisficing, limited cognitive resources\
Maybe: Information foraging, search, explore exploit

*One paragraph introducing our research as a synthesis of the two prior paragraphs, how are we addressing the short comings of the two previous approaches*\
We have a task with a clear ground truth on information gain and a simple optimal strategy (binary search). We can use this measure of optimality and combine it with a measure taken from psych-math/pedagogy lit on what is a hard or easy interval to find the midpoint of. Then, we can look for each guess whether the information foraging is optimal as a function of the hardness of finding the optimal sample (the midpoint). 
This adds a resource rational perspective of cognitive cost to information gain lit. 

## Methods
We needed a task with the following properties:
* ground truth optimal
* clear correct strategy
* iterated samplings (so that we can trade off more samples and easier samples)
* varying level of hardness to follow that strategy
* naturalistic
* video games make cool naturalistic datasets

### Task
*Introduce number guessing game*\
